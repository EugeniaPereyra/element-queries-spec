# element-queries-spec

A spec for a Container-Style Element Query Syntax

## What is this about?

This spec aims to define a container query-style syntax for scoped styles and element queries, as well a number of related concepts: new selectors, CSS functions, and new units that make them more usable & useful.

## Who am I?

I'm an independent web developer, not affiliated with any major company. The research & development contained in this spec is my own.

## How you can help

At this stage the work on this spec is focused on taking the existing EQCSS syntax for element queries as implemented by the EQCSS project and defining them in a more formal way so that other plugin builders could design plugins or tools that work with the EQCSS syntax as implemented by EQCSS.js

In the future once the first version of this document is complete, there will be an opportunity to extend the features described.

For now, the most productive way to provide input would be by contributing to the conversation in the [Gitter chat room for the EQCSS project](https://gitter.im/eqcss/eqcss)
